## 🧠 Overview

**Face-Recognition** is a versatile developer toolkit designed for real-time facial identification and verification.  
It streamlines building facial recognition systems for **security**, **authentication**, and **attendance tracking** by integrating pre-trained models, face encodings, and live recognition pipelines.

In short: faster builds, fewer headaches, better accuracy.

## 🎯 Why Face-Recognition?

This project accelerates delivery of accurate and efficient facial recognition solutions with the following core capabilities:

- 🎭 **Face Detection**  
  Uses pre-trained Haar Cascade classifiers for fast, reliable face detection in images and live video streams.

- 🧬 **Face Encoding**  
  Generates and stores facial embeddings for high-speed recognition and matching.

- 🎥 **Real-Time Recognition**  
  Performs live face identification via webcam, enabling automated attendance and security checks.

- ✅ **Dependency Validation**  
  Ensures all required libraries are correctly installed for smooth execution.

- 📂 **Dataset Creation**  
  Automates face image capture and storage to build scalable recognition datasets.
